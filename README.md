## Overview

Dashboards can help answer questions like:

- How many resources do I have?
- How old are my resources?
- Are there any publicly accessible resources?
- Is encryption enabled and what keys are used for encryption?
- Is versioning enabled?
- What are the relationships between closely connected resources like IAM users, groups, and policies?

Dashboards are available for 15+ services, including CloudTrail, EC2, IAM, RDS, S3, VPC, and more!

## Getting started

### Installation

Download and install Steampipe (https://steampipe.io/downloads). Or use Brew:

```sh
brew tap turbot/tap
brew install steampipe
```

Install the AWS plugin with [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io):

```sh
steampipe plugin install aws
```

Clone:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-aws-insights.git
cd steampipe-mod-aws-insights
```

### Usage

Before running any dashboards, it's recommended to generate your AWS credential report:

```sh
aws iam generate-credential-report
```

Start your dashboard server to get started:

```sh
steampipe dashboard
```

By default, the dashboard interface will then be launched in a new browser window at https://localhost:9194. From here, you can view dashboards and reports.

### Credentials

This mod uses the credentials configured in the [Steampipe AWS plugin](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws).

### Configuration

No extra configuration is required.
