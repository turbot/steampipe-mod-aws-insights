# AWS Insights Mod for Powerpipe

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Steampipe mods are [migrating to Powerpipe format](https://powerpipe.io) to gain new features. This mod currently works with both Steampipe and Powerpipe, but will only support Powerpipe from v1.x onward.

An AWS dashboarding tool that can be used to view dashboards and reports across all of your AWS accounts.

## Overview

Dashboards can help answer questions like:

- How many resources do I have?
- How old are my resources?
- Are there any publicly accessible resources?
- Is encryption enabled and what keys are used for encryption?
- Is versioning enabled?
- What are the relationships between closely connected resources like IAM users, groups, and policies?

Dashboards are available for 15+ services, including CloudTrail, EC2, IAM, RDS, S3, VPC, and more!

### Documentation

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install Powerpipe (https://powerpipe.io/downloads), or use Brew:

```sh
brew install turbot/tap/powerpipe
```

This mod also requires [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) with the [AWS plugin](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws) as the data source. Install Steampipe (https://steampipe.io/downloads), or use Brew:

```sh
brew install turbot/tap/steampipe
steampipe plugin install aws
```

Steampipe will automatically use your default AWS credentials. Optionally, you can [setup multiple accounts](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws#multi-account-connections) or [customize AWS credentials](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws#configuring-aws-credentials).

Finally, install the mod:

```sh
mkdir dashboards
cd dashboards
powerpipe mod init
powerpipe mod install github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-aws-insights
```

### Browsing Dashboards

Start Steampipe as the data source:

```sh
steampipe service start
```

Start the dashboard server:

```sh
powerpipe server
```

Browse and view your dashboards at **http://localhost:9033**.

### Running Dashboards in Your Terminal

Instead of running dashboards on the server, you can also run them within your
terminal with the `powerpipe dashboard` command:

List available benchmarks:

```sh
powerpipe dashboard list
```

Run a benchmark:

```sh
powerpipe dashboard run rds_db_instance_dashboard
```

Different output formats are also available, for more information please see
[Output Formats](https://powerpipe.io/docs/reference/cli/benchmark#output-formats).
