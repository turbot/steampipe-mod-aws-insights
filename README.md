## Overview

Dashboards can help answer questions like:

- How many resources do I have?
- How old are my resources?
- Are there any publicly accessible resources?
- Is encryption enabled and what keys are used for encryption?
- Is versioning enabled?
- What are the relationships between closely connected resources like IAM users, groups, and policies?

Dashboards are available for 15+ services, including CloudTrail, EC2, IAM, RDS, S3, VPC, and more!

## Getting started

```shell

```

2) Install the AWS plugin:
