# Index of dashboards included in the AWS Insights Mod

DevOps professionals use the AWS insights mod to visualize cloud intelligence and security metrics using interactive dashboards. Report on AWS resource configuration, visualize relationships, and aggregate metrics to better understand your cloud infrastructure. The dashboards are specified using a "low code" HCL format (similar to Terraform). Making it easy to inspect, modify and compose new dashboards to meet specific compliance and security objectives for your organization.
