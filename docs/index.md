# AWS Insights Mod - Visualize and report on resource configuration across your AWS accounts.

DevOps professionals use the AWS insights mod to visualize cloud intelligence and security metrics using interactive dashboards. Report on AWS resource configuration, visualize relationships, and aggregate metrics to better understand your cloud infrastructure. The dashboards are specified using a "low code" HCL format (similar to Terraform). Making it easy to inspect, modify and compose new dashboards to meet specific compliance and security objectives for your organization.

## Overview

Resource type **Dashboards** have interactive elements that can answer questions like:

- How many of this resource type do I have? 
- Counts by accounts and regions?
- Cost of these resources over time.
- Percentage of resources that are configured in specific ways (e.g. encryption on?)
- How old are my resources?

Resource **detail reports** can be reached by drilling down from dashboards or manually selecting the resource name.  They drill into a **specific resource** and can answer detailed configuration questions and provide a visualization of relationships to other resources. Use these to answer deep questions:
- What are the relationships between this resource and others?
- Is this resource publicly accessible?
- Is encryption enabled and what keys are used for encryption?
- Is versioning enabled?
- What networking ingress and egress rules are associated with this resource.


Dashboards are available for 15+ services, including CloudTrail, EC2, IAM, RDS, S3, VPC, and more!

## References

[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to authenticated customers on a metered pay-as-you-go basis.

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

[Steampipe Mods](https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/mod-resources#mod) are collections of `named queries`, codified `controls` that can be used to test current configuration of your cloud resources against a desired configuration, and `dashboards` that organize and display key pieces of information.

## Documentation

## Getting started

### Installation

Download and install Steampipe (https://steampipe.io/downloads). Or use Brew:

```sh
brew tap turbot/tap
brew install steampipe
```

Install the AWS plugin with [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io):

```sh
steampipe plugin install aws
```

Clone:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-aws-insights.git
cd steampipe-mod-aws-insights
```

### Usage

Before running any dashboards, it's recommended to generate your AWS credential report:

```sh
aws iam generate-credential-report
```

Start your dashboard server to get started:

```sh
steampipe dashboard
```

By default, the dashboard interface will then be launched in a new browser window at http://localhost:9194. From here, you can view dashboards and reports.

### Credentials

This mod uses the credentials configured in the [Steampipe AWS plugin](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws).

### Configuration

No extra configuration is required.
