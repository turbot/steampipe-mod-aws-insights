## Overview

Dashboards can help answer questions like:

- How many resources do I have?
- How old are my resources?
- Are there any publicly accessible resources?
- Is encryption enabled and what keys are used for encryption?
- Is versioning enabled?
- What are the relationships between closely connected resources like IAM users, groups, and policies?

Dashboards are available for 15+ services, including CloudTrail, EC2, IAM, RDS, S3, VPC, and more!

## References

[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to authenticated customers on a metered pay-as-you-go basis.

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

[Steampipe Mods](https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/mod-resources#mod) are collections of `named queries`, codified `controls` that can be used to test current configuration of your cloud resources against a desired configuration, and `dashboards` that organize and display key pieces of information.
